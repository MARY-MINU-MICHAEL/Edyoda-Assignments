        "Answer: (B)\n",
        "7.  What is pass in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:   Pass means, no-operation Python statement, or in other words it is a place holder in compound statement, where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What Does The Continue Do In Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:   The continue is a jump statement in Python which moves the control to execute the next iteration in a loop leaving all the remaining instructions in the block unexecuted. \n",
        "The continue statement is applicable for both the “while” and “for” loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. .When Should You Use The “Break” In Python? \n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:   Python provides a break statement to exit from a loop. Whenever the break hits in the code, the control of the program immediately exits from the body of the loop. \n",
        "The break statement in a nested loop causes the control to exit from the inner iterative block.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What Is The Difference Between Pass And Continue In Python? \n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:   The continue statement makes the loop to resume from the next iteration. \n",
        "On the contrary, the pass statement instructs to do nothing, and the remainder of the code executes as usual.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What are types of Operator are used in Python? \n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:          Arithmetic Operators\n",
        "Comparison Operators\n",
        "Python Assignment Operators\n",
        "Logical Operators or Bitwise Operators\n",
        "Membership Operators\n",
        "Identity Operators\n",
        "\n",
        "12.When do you choose a list over a tuple?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: When there is an immutable ordered list of elements we choose tuple. Because we cannot add/remove an element from the tuple. On the other hand, we can add elements to a list using append () or extend() or insert(), etc., and delete elements from a list using remove() or pop().Simple tuples are immutable, and lists are not.\n",
        "  \n",
        "13. How does For loop and While loop differ in Python and when do you   choose to use them?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:  For loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection types such as List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary.\n",
        "While loop is the actual looping feature that is used in any other programming language. This is how Python differs in handling loops from the other programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is lambda in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:  Anonymous function means that a function is without a name. As we already know that def keyword is used to define the normal functions and the lambda keyword is used to create anonymous functions.\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Mention what are the rules for local and global variables in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:  Local variables: If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere within the function's body, it's assumed to be local.\n",
        "Global variables: Those variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.Mention the use of the split function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:  The use of the split function in Python is that it breaks a string into shorter strings using the defined separator. It gives a list of all words present in the string.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the two types of functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:  There are two types of functions in Python: built-in functions and user-defined functions. Built-in functions are functions that are already defined in the Python language, such as the print() function. User-defined functions are functions that are created by the user, and they can be created to do anything that the user wants them to do.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. Do Python functions have return values? If yes, then how many can they have?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:  Yes, Python functions can have return values. They can have a single return value, or they can have multiple return values.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Can you explain what decorators are in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:  Decorators are a way to dynamically alter the behaviour of a function. They are usually used as a way to add functionality to an existing function without having to modify the code of the function itself. Decorators are typically written in the form of a wrapper function.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Can you explain what recursion is and why it’s useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:  Recursion is a function that calls itself. It’s useful because it allows you to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. \n"
